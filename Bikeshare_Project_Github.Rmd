###ANSWER QUESTION 1: Discussion
I wanted to investigate the differences and similarities in the rental time of the bikes in the three cities within 24 hours of users picking up the bike; i.e. how long does it take people to bring the bike back to a station after having rented it? To answer this question, I calculated the mean and median value for all rental times (i.e. the mean and median of all trip durations) 24 hours and less for each city and plotted the corresponding distribution curves.

What I found was that the distributions look very similar for the three cities: left skewed, with their peaks at a similar time. The graph for New York City shows a slightly higher and more defined peak than those of the other two cities. This fits with the fact that the medan and median rental durations in New York City is lower than in Chicago and Washington.

Based on these results, I would like to further investigate these curves to see if othere parameters (such as the user type) will show additional differences between the three cities.

###QUESTION 2
Are there differences in the types of users (customer vs subscriber) for each city that rent and return bikes within 24 hours?

###ANSWER QUESTION 2: Discussion
The graphs show that in all three cities subscribers tend to rent the bikes for shorter durations than customers. This fits with the distribution being left-skewed for the subscribers, and right-skewed for the customers. This trend is seen most defined in New York City.

To further investigate the differences in the behaviour of the subscribers and customers, I want to see if there are differenes in the days of the week when the bikes are picked up.

###QUESTION 3:
Are there differences in the days of the week when customers and subscribers rent bikes for 24 hours or less?

###ANSWER QUESTION 3: Discussion
The graphs show that in all cities subscribers rent more bikes during the week days Monday to Friday, and less on Saturday and Sunday. Customers follow the opposite trend, and rent more on Saturday and Sunday than during days Monday to Friday. Interestingly, this trend amongst the customers is not as extreme in New York City as it is in the other two cities. 

In absolute numbers, we see significantly more subscribers than customers, and each day sees a different amount of bike rentals. To investigate this a bit more clearly, I calculated the percentage of customers and subscribers from the total number of bike rentals on each week day.  In Chicago, New York City, and Washington, the percentage of customers on week day range between 9.7%-17.0%, 5.9%-8.2%, and 16.9%-23.9%, repectively. On weekends the customer numbers are higher, woth 40.5%-40.9%, 19.5%-21.1%, and 45.3%-43.7%, respectively. As we can see, the percentage of customers in New York City is a lot lower than in the other two cities. For the subscribers, the percentages show the same trend: a drop in subscriber rentals on the weekend, with New York City showing the smallest decrease.
