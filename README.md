### Project Title
Investigating the Bikeshare Database using R

### Description
This Database contains rental data from three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using R, this database was investigated to answer the following questions:
Question 1: How long does it take people to return their rented bikes within 24 hours of having picked it up?
Question 2: Are there differences in the types of users (customer vs subscriber) for each city that rent and return bikes within 24 hours?
Question 3: Are there differences in the days of the week when customers and subscribers rent bikes for 24 hours or less?

### Files used
The R file with the code as well as the corresponding html output are available in this repository. The data is found the three csv files, one for each city: "chicago.csv", "nyc.csv", and "washington.csv"; these files are stored only locally.  

### Credits
The data was supplied by Udacity in the Nanodegree Program "Programming for Datascience with R". Credits go to the mentors and teachers of Udacity for their teaching and trouble-shooting support.
